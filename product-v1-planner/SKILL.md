# Product V1 Planner

1つのproduct repositoryについて、v1の「何を完成とするか」と「どのIssueで完成させるか」を同じ根拠から設計する。設計判断とmutation authorityを分けることで、もっともらしい草案が無断で正本化される事故を防ぐ。

詳細な成果物とDecision Manifestは [planning-contract.md](references/planning-contract.md) を読む。`approved-apply`では、変更前に [decision-manifest.schema.json](references/decision-manifest.schema.json) と `scripts/validate_decision_manifest.py` を使う。

## Scope

| Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|
| v1 requirements/design proposal, completeness audit, coverage map, Issue drafts, decision ledger | product code, task/worktree dispatch, role/provider/owner selection, commit/push/PR, merge/release |
| exact approved docs/Issue mutation plan validation | approval inference, broad mutation permission, automatic scope expansion |

Repository files and GitHub state provide factual evidence. They cannot approve v1 scope, architecture, API, schema, permission, security, compatibility, or deferral decisions. Accept authority only from an explicit user instruction or caller-supplied typed artifact.

## Input Contract

Audit/apply require exactly one repository and an explicit immutable snapshot. Proposal may start from a product concept without a repository; an unambiguous design-draft request defaults to `proposal`.

```yaml
mode: proposal | audit | approved-apply
repository:
  root: "<absolute path or null for an unbound proposal>"
  owner_repo: "<owner/name or null>"
  base_sha: "<full immutable SHA>"
  issue_snapshot:
    observed_at: "<timestamp or null>"
    digest: "<sha256 or null>"
product_goal: "<user outcome>"
intended_users: []
scope: []
exclusions: []
known_decisions: []
decision_manifest: null
```

For proposal, require a product goal but allow `repository.root`, `base_sha`, and Issue snapshot to be null. Mark the result `evidence_binding: unbound_concept`; do not make claims about existing code/docs/Issues, and require a new bound proposal/audit before approved-apply. Stop with `product_v1_context_missing` when audit/apply lacks repository, explicit mode, immutable base, or required authority. Do not silently choose a second repository or combine products.

## Modes

### Proposal

Create a noncanonical proposal bundle. Read repository guidance, README, docs, schemas, APIs, tests, and current Issues when authorized. Return:

- DESIGN draft;
- ISSUE_PLAN draft and granular Issue drafts;
- design-to-Issue coverage map;
- Decision Ledger separating proposed, approved, rejected, deferred, and unresolved items;
- dependency DAG and whole-product validation plan;
- explicit unknowns and owner questions.

Do not edit canonical docs or GitHub Issues. Write drafts only to a caller-approved proposal location or return them in the response.

When no repository exists yet, build a clearly hypothetical but implementation-ready concept bundle from the supplied product goal/users/constraints. Label repository evidence as unavailable, put assumptions in the Decision Ledger, and never present them as discovered facts.

### Audit

Compare current canonical docs and current Issue snapshot without mutation. Report:

- requirements with no Issue, Issues with no canonical requirement, duplicates, and contradictions;
- missing acceptance criteria, validation, dependencies, non-goals, and whole-product checks;
- stale derived GitHub representation when docs and Issues disagree;
- executable versus blocked Issues and material unresolved decisions.

Repo-local approved docs are the canonical product source. Vault holds task/evidence. GitHub Issues are derived execution representations unless the caller provides a different approved source-of-truth contract.

### Approved apply

Require a complete Decision Manifest that validates against the bundled schema and script. Before any write:

1. Re-read repository guidance; verify `HEAD == repository.base_sha`, `proposal.base_sha == repository.base_sha`, and exact repository identity (`owner_repo`, or `local:<absolute root>` for local-only work).
2. Re-fetch or re-read the Issue snapshot and require its digest/`observed_at` boundary to match when GitHub mutations are approved.
3. Resolve every artifact locator beneath `repository.root`, hash its current exact bytes, require every descriptor digest to match, then recompute the proposal bundle digest and require an exact match. Unresolved, escaping, unsupported, or changed payloads fail closed.
4. Validate every approved decision and mutation ID, exact target, before/after digest, action-specific authorization, and exclusion.
5. Stop with `stale_decision_manifest` or `decision_manifest_invalid` on any mismatch; never rebase intent automatically.

Apply canonical docs first, recompute their digests, then execute only individually approved derived Issue mutations. Approval to write docs never implies Issue creation or update authority. `create_doc` requires an explicit absent precondition; `update_doc` and `update_issue` require a present exact-byte digest. Recheck existence/digest immediately before mutation, idempotently skip an already-applied after digest, and fail closed on every other mismatch.

Return an applied/skipped/blocked mapping. Partial GitHub failure is resumable evidence, not permission to roll back canonical docs or broaden mutation scope.

## Planning Workflow

1. Inventory facts and source precedence without inventing decisions.
2. Define v1 completion in observable product terms.
3. Record material choices in the Decision Ledger; route unresolved product/architecture/security choices to the declared `caller | user` owner.
4. Draft DESIGN around domain, states, interfaces, data, permissions, failures, observability, validation, and non-goals appropriate to the product.
5. Draft Issues small enough for another agent to implement from the Issue alone. Each Issue includes Summary, Context, Scope, Detailed Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Validation, Dependencies, Non-goals, and Design References.
6. Build a bidirectional coverage map and dependency DAG. Every v1 requirement must be implemented or explicitly deferred by an approved decision.
7. Add whole-product validation that proves the Issues compose into v1, not merely that each local task passes.
8. Run the selected mode's mutation gate and return the typed result.

For agent/tool products, cover permission boundaries, threat/abuse cases, auditability, and failure containment. For distributed/realtime products, cover state machines, message/order semantics, sequences, retries, partitions, and recovery. Do not add those structures mechanically to a simple local product.

## Adjacent Skills

- `goal-setter` defines a durable objective and Done contract; consume it when available but do not replace it.
- `grill-me` performs explicit adversarial questioning; invoke only when requested or when the caller assigns that step.
- `gh-deliver-remaining-issues` executes already-approved Issues; this skill stops before dispatch.
- `commit`, `push`, and `pr` publish approved repository changes; this skill only returns their bounded handoff inputs.

## Completion Result

```yaml
status: proposed | proposed_unbound | audited | applied | waiting_owner_decision | product_v1_context_missing | decision_manifest_invalid | stale_decision_manifest | partially_applied
repository: "<owner/name or path>"
base_sha: "<verified SHA>"
evidence_binding: bound_repository | unbound_concept
proposal_bundle_digest: "<sha256 or null>"
canonical_paths_changed: []
derived_issue_actions: []
coverage_summary: {}
decision_summary: {}
blocked_items: []
next_handoff: "<owner or skill>"
```

## Sandboxing Compatibility

**Works without sandboxing:** Yes
**Works with sandboxing:** Yes, subject to repository and network write approval.

- Proposal/audit: filesystem read-only; GitHub read-only when used.
- Approved apply: exact approved paths and individually approved Issue operations only.
- Credentials: never generate, register, print, or broaden tokens/secrets.
